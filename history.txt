QClip Version History
=====================
-fixed +added *modified

0.9.3.1 (May 30, 2008)
----------------------
- The default queue is now saved during Windows shutdown.

0.9.3   (December 29, 2007)
---------------------------
+ Added customizable date / time format to the common items
  available under general preferences.
+ Added logic to block programs that place data on the clipboard
  multiple times for a single copy.
+ Added possible key shortcuts to access the five most recent
  items in the queue, and the first five custom items.  These are
  unassigned by default.
- Improved handling of bitmaps.  Fixes the strange three-pixel shift
  problem that occurred when using Print Screen on WinXP.
- Now using local time for dates (was always GMT before).

0.9.2   (November 28, 2006)
---------------------------
+ QClip now tries to use relative file paths when appropriate (e.g.
  when selecting common items from the application directory).
+ Added the ability to empty the queue from the tray menu.
+ "Files" in the format settings now includes various registered
  application formats used by Windows Explorer to augment the
  standard "file" clipboard format.  Explorer would occasionally do
  strange things when these were left out.
- Made the Shortcut Key box in the key settings wider.
- The apply button under format settings functions correctly now.
- When copying files on Unicode systems, the number of items copied
  was displayed incorrectly in the popup menu.  Fixed.
- On WinXP, clicking the tray icon after exiting the program would
  cause a crash.  Fixed.

0.9.1   (November 16, 2006)
--------------------------
+ Added unlimited queue option.
- Shortcut keys for long/short date work now.
- Menu commands to paste custom items were ignored.  Fixed.
- Dates were pasted in the wrong text format (ANSI/Unicode).  Fixed.
- Pasting from the popup menu should be somewhat more reliable now.
