About
</div>
<div class="content">
<p class="first">
QClip is a clipboard extender for Windows, similar to that found
in the Microsoft Office suite, with the exception that it can
copy and paste data to and from any other program, arbitrarily.
The program monitors the standard Windows clipboard and copies any
data it sees there into a queue.  You can then access the data
later on through hotkeys defined by the program.
</p>
<p>
QClip is designed with a minimalist approach - it has no UI to
speak of, uses few system resources, and does not impact the
registry.
</p>

<div>
<div class="title2">
Installation
</div>
<div class="content">
<p class="first">
QClip requires no installation; simply place the executable in
your favorite direcory and run it.  The program will happily run from
flash drives and the like.  Optionally, if you would like QClip
to start automatically at Windows startup, you may also place a
shortcut to the executable in your Startup folder.
</p>
<p class="last">
QClip does not modify the Windows registry; rather it stores all
configuration data in an .ini file in the same directory as the
executable (this file is created automatically).  By default, the
application will also create the file autosave.qcl, which stores
clipboard data between sessions.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div>
<div class="title2">
Basic Usage
</div>
<div class="content">
<p class="first">
When launched, QClip will place an icon in the system tray.
Right-clicking the icon will allow you to exit the program or
acess the Preferences dialog.  Most interaction however, is done
through keyboard shortcuts.
</p>
<p>
Whenever you copy data to the Windows clipboard, QClip will add
it to a queue.  You can then "pop" data from either end of the
queue by pressing <kbd>Ctrl-Alt-F</kbd> (for
the most recent item) or <kbd>Ctrl-Alt-B</kbd>
(for the oldest).  This will remove the data from the queue and
paste it into whatever application has focus.
For example:  Highlight some text and press
<kbd>Ctrl-C</kbd>, then highlight some more
and press <kbd>Ctrl-C</kbd> again.  Repeat
this a few times.  Now open Notepad and press
<kbd>Ctrl-Alt-B</kbd> a few times.
You will see the various text items appear in the order you
copied them.  Pressing <kbd>Ctrl-Alt-F</kbd>
would have pasted the text in reverse order.
</p>
<p>
You can also "peek" at data in the queue using
<kbd>Ctrl-Alt-Shift-F</kbd>
and <kbd>Ctrl-Alt-Shift-B</kbd>.  This will
paste data from either end of the queue without removing it.
</p>
<p>
Another way to access clipboard data is to press
<kbd>Ctrl-Alt-V</kbd>.  This will create a
popup menu, showing every item currently in the queue, as well
as any user-defined "common items".  Selecting an item will
then paste it.  Note that when using this method, QClip is only
able to display data in simple formats (text, bitmap); other
formats will be shown as "Binary Data".
</p>
<p>
Also note that by default, the queue is limited to ten items,
so anything older than the tenth item is lost.
</p>
<p class="last">
Furthermore, because of the way QClip interacts with the
Windows clipboard, the standard Windows paste operation
(<kbd>Ctrl-V</kbd>) will use whatever data
QClip has most recently accessed, either through a copy or a
paste.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div>
<div class="title2">
Files
</div>
<div class="content">
<p class="first">
QClip can save the current queue to a .qcl file, which can
be loaded into the program at some later time (this ability is
available by right-clicking the system tray icon).  So, for
example, you could copy a bunch of items, save the queue, then
paste them on a different computer.
</p>
<p class="last">
Another use for .qcl files is to save commonly used items.  QClip
is able to add items from a user-defined file to the popup menu
(see the General Preferences dialog).  These items exist in a
separate queue from the main one, and are not affected by copy
and paste operations.

Preferences
</div>
<div class="content">
<div class="title3">
General
</div>
<ul>
<li>
<span class="pref">Queue Size</span> - Sets the maximum number
of items the queue can hold.  Shrinking the queue may cause
data to be lost, if the maximum size had been reached.
</li>
<li>
<span class="pref">Unlimited queue</span> - If this is checked,
QClip will dynamically resize the queue as you copy items, and shrink
it as you remove them.  The size of the queue is then limited only by
available memory.
</li>
<li>
<span class="pref">Auto-save and restore the queue between
sessions</span> - If this is checked, on exit, QClip will save
the queue to the file autosave.qcl.  This file will then be loaded
the next time the application is started.
</li>
<li>
<span class="pref">Preview bitmaps in the popup menu</span> - If
this is checked, QClip will attempt to display bitmap data in the
popup menu.  Otherwise, a general description of each bitmap is given
(i.e. height, width, bit depth).
</li>
<li>
<p>
<span class="pref">Common Items</span> - If these options are set,
QClip will attempt to add commonly used data to the popup menu.
This can be one of the pre-defined items (the date in long or short
format), or a user-created .qcl file.
</p>
<p>
<em>Custom date / time formats</em> - One of the common items available
is a customizable date / time string.  The format codes are the same
as used in the Regional and Language Options in the Windows control
panel, which are:
<ul>
<li>
<strong>M</strong>, <strong>MM</strong>, <strong>MMM</strong>, or
<strong>MMMM</strong> - the month as a one or two digit number,
three letter abbreviation, or full text.
</li>
<li>
<strong>d</strong>, <strong>dd</strong>, <strong>ddd</strong>, or
<strong>dddd</strong> - the day, following the same pattern.
</li>
<li>
<strong>y</strong>, <strong>yy</strong>, or <strong>yyyy</strong>
- the year as a one, two, or four digit number.
</li>
<li>
<strong>h</strong> or <strong>hh</strong> - the hour as a one or
two digit number, on a 12-hour clock.
</li>
<li>
<strong>H</strong> or <strong>HH</strong> - the hour on a 24-hour clock.
</li>
<li>
<strong>m</strong> or <strong>mm</strong> - minutes.
</li>
<li>
<strong>s</strong> or <strong>ss</strong> - seconds.
</li>
<li>
<strong>t</strong> or <strong>tt</strong> - AM or PM.
</li>
</ul>
Other characters will appear unchanged in the formatted string. "%" is
an escape character, so for example, %d represents the letter d, not
the current day.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="title3">
Keys
</div>
<p>
Nearly all actions in QClip are controllable through hotkeys,
though only a few are defined by default (Pop and Peek, Show
Popup Menu).  To define a new hotkey, simply select an action
from the list, click the "Shortcut Key" box, and press a key
combination.
</p>

<div class="title3">
Formats
</div>
<p>
Internally, QClip is format-blind.  The Formats dialog exits
to allow you to disable certain kinds of data.  This is
useful because applications often place data on the clipboard
in several redundant formats, which can consume large amounts
of memory.
</p>
<p class="last">
The first six checkboxes refer to standard clipboard formats
defined by Windows.  The last of these, "Other Standard
Formats", is a catch-all for a number of formats not in
common use.  "Private Formats" refers to custom-format data
that is not intended to used outside the application that
created it.  Alternatively, "Registered Application Formats"
refers to custom-format data that is meant to be shared
among applications.  Rich text is probably the most common
example.
